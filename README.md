# GrainPalette-A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning
This project is about creating a smart computer program that can look at a picture of rice and tell what type of rice it is. We used a special method in Artificial Intelligence called Deep Learning to make the program learn from lots of rice images.
